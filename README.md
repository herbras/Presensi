Created an innovative attendance system for students using AstroJS, Svelte, Uno CSS, View Transitions, and the Haversine Formula, deployed through Cloudflare Worker. This system replaces traditional paper methods with a more efficient QR code and OTP-based presence verification. It leverages geolocation algorithms and smooth UI transitions to provide an optimal, paperless attendance solution, enhancing the academic experience with speed and convenience.
